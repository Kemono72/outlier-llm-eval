# Outlier.ai LLM Evaluation – Project Summary

This project reflects my contract work with Outlier.ai, where I contributed to improving large language model performance through human evaluation and prompt engineering.

## 📌 Goals of the Project
- Evaluate AI responses for helpfulness, tone, clarity and factual correctness
- Detect and document hallucinations and inconsistencies
- Apply reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) principles
- Improve LLM behavior through structured rating systems

## 🎯 Key Skills Applied
- Prompt engineering strategies
- Bias and tone detection
- Scoring and labeling completions
- Structured review of generative AI output
- Working with evaluation frameworks in a production setting

## ⚠️ Note
This repository includes only general, public-facing practices and descriptions. No proprietary data or exact modules from Outlier.ai are shared.

🧬 This experience strengthened my understanding of LLM limitations and trained me in human-aligned AI behavior and rating methodologies.
